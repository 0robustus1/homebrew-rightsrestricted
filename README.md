To use this tap, you'll of course need to have [homebrew][1] installed.
Homebrew is a package manager for Mac OS X.

In order to use this tap you'll need to perform some basic command-line tasks:

- `brew tap 0robustus1/rightsrestricted` to make this tap available to your
  homebrew installation
- To be more explicit, `brew tap 0robustus1/homebrew-rightrestricted` will work
  as well.
